## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP techniques are used to analyze and understand human language, and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, word embedding, tokenization, and lemmatization.

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use NLP techniques to analyze text data. Whether you're new to NLP or an experienced practitioner, these notebooks will help you get up and running with the latest techniques and tools in the field.

## Notebooks

The notebooks in this repository cover a range of topics, including:

- Sentiment analysis
